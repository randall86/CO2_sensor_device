# UN600 ETCO2 Sensor library

Arduino library to support UN600 ETCO2 Capnograph Module. 
The devices utilise the Hardware Serial. This library depends 
on the Arduino HardwareSerial library.

The UN-600 Module is designed for sidestream measurement of CO2 
using non-dispersed infrared absorption technology. 
It is used to measure End-Tidal Carbon Dioxide (ETCO2) and 
respiratory rate (RR) and etc.

## Tested working on the following devices:

*   ESP32-WROOM-32
